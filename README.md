# Data-Handling-Level-1
Contains simple data handling problems to code.
This is a practice section for the C Programming given by the ilearn (Learning Saga).

# 1
Write a program to accept an integer as input from the user representing an ASCII value and print its character equivalent.
Input Format:
A Single Integer 'num'
Output Format:
Display the character that corresponds to the ASCII Integer

# 2
Write a program to accept a float value as input from the user and print its closest integer value.
Input Format:
A Single float value 'num'.
Output Format:
Display the closest Integer.

# 3
Write a program to accept 2 numbers as input from the user. Print the 2 numbers such that the second number is 17 width spaces away from the first.
Input Format:
Two Space Separated integers - num1, num2
Output Format:
Display the two numbers with correct width space and without space in between.

# 4
Write a program to accept a float value as input from the user and print it rounded off to 3 decimal places.
Input Format:
A Single float value - 'num'
Output Format:
Display the float value with 3 precision

# 5
Write a program to accept a number as input (Octal or Hexadecimal) from the user and print it decimal equivalent.
Input Format:
A Single Integer 'num' - denoting either a hexadecimal or octal value
Output Format:
Display the Integer in decimal format

# 6
Write a program to accept a float value and an integer as input. The integer represents the precision. Print the float value according to the precision.
Input Format:
Two Space Separated numbers 'num' ( Float value ) and 'precision' ( Integer )
Output Format:
A Single Float value with appropriate precision.

# 7
Write a program to accept a float value input. Print it with a width of 15 and rounded off to 2 decimal places.
Input Format:
A Single Float value
Output Format:
Display the Float value with 15 width and 2 precision

# 8
Write a program to print "Welcome to the World of "C" Programming", with the C in double quotes.

# 9
Write a program to print %.

# 10
Write a program to print \r.
